# SpaceTimer
A simple Timer using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing the user to start, pause, and reset the countdown that updates visually and in the website tab.

The purpose of creating this project was to put into practice my learning of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one project, developing my programming logic and problem-solving skills during its creation. I don't intend to modify it in the future as it was all part of the learning process.
